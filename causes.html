                    <h2 style="background-color: darkred; color: aliceblue; padding: 5px; border-radius: 10px;">Causes</h2><br>
                    <p><b>1. Heavy Rainfall:</b> Extended periods of heavy rainfall, especially in areas with poor
                        drainage systems, can lead to excessive water accumulation and flooding. Tropical storms,
                        hurricanes, and monsoons often bring heavy rainfall, contributing to flooding.</p><br>

                    <p><b>2. Dam and Levee Failures:</b> The failure of dams and levees can release large volumes of
                        water downstream, causing catastrophic flooding in areas that would not typically flood.</p><br>

                    <p><b>3. Urbanization and Poor Drainage:</b>Urban development can lead to increased impervious
                        surfaces like roads and buildings, which hinder water absorption. Inadequate drainage systems
                        can exacerbate flooding in urban areas.</p><br>

                    <p><b>4. Deforestation:</b> The removal of forests can reduce the natural water absorption capacity
                        of an area, leading to increased runoff and a higher risk of flooding.</p><br>

                    <p><b>5. Storm Surges:</b> Coastal areas can experience flooding due to storm surges caused by
                        tropical storms, hurricanes, or typhoons. Strong winds and low atmospheric pressure push
                        seawater onto the land, leading to coastal flooding. </p>

                    <h2 style="background-color:olive ; color: aliceblue; padding: 5px; border-radius: 10px;">Effects</h2><br>
                    <p><b>1. Loss of Lives:</b> Flooding events can result in the loss of human lives, as people may
                        become trapped or swept away by fast-moving water. Drowning is a common cause of death during
                        floods.</p><br>
                    <p><b>2. Contamination:</b> Floodwaters can carry contaminants, including sewage, hazardous
                        materials, and pollutants, which can contaminate water supplies and soil. This poses health
                        risks to both humans and wildlife.</p><br>
                    <p><b>3. Agricultural Damage:</b> Flooding can destroy crops and agricultural land, leading to food
                        shortages, increased food prices, and economic losses for farmers.
                    </p><br>
                    <p><b>4. Disruption of Services:</b> Floods can disrupt essential services, such as clean water,
                        electricity, and transportation, which can further impede recovery efforts.</p><br>
                    <p><b>5. Long-Term Recovery:</b> Recovery from a flood can be a lengthy and costly process.
                        Rebuilding infrastructure, restoring ecosystems, and addressing social and economic impacts can
                        take years.</p>
